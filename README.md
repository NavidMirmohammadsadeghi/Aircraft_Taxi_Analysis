# Aircraft_Taxi_Analysis
Taxi Event Extraction Based on PDARS Data.
PDARS reports the flights' trajectories in terms of latitude and longitude for times steps of 1 second. The parser which I've developed is not only useful in understanding the airport operations (arrivals/departures), but also is good for estimating unimpeded and total taxi times for each flight.
The user interface helps the user to visualize flight tracks and apply visual data analysis on both arrival and departure flights.
